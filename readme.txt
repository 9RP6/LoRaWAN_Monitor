1. System OverviewThe system replaces a high-maintenance Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) setup that suffered from range limitations (requiring gateways to be placed near hives, leading to theft) and high power consumption (~200mA peak)3333. The new LoRaWAN architecture uses a Long Range (LoRa) radio link to allow the gateway to be placed in a secure location far from the apiary4.Core ComponentsEnd Node: LoRa-E5 (WLE5JC) Development Board (ARM Cortex-M4 + LoRa SoC)5555.Sensor: Sensirion SHT45 (High-precision Temperature/Humidity) connected via I2C666.Gateway: Raspberry Pi 4 + WM1302 LoRaWAN Hat (SX1302 chipset)7777777.Software: STM32CubeWL SDK, Semtech Packet Forwarder, and ChirpStack Network Server8.2. Hardware AssemblySensor WiringThe Sensirion SHT45 communicates with the LoRa-E5 via the I2C2 peripheral999.Connect VIN on the SHT45 to 3V3 on the LoRa-E5 board10.Connect GND to GND11.Connect SCL to PB14 (I2C2 SCL)12.Connect SDA to PA15 (I2C2 SDA)13.Gateway SetupMount the WM1302 Hat onto the Raspberry Pi 4 GPIO headers14.Connect the 915 MHz antenna to the U.FL/SMA connector on the Hat1515.Warning: Never power the gateway without the antenna attached, as it can damage the concentrator chip.Connect the Pi to the internet via Ethernet or Wi-Fi for the backhaul16.3. Firmware DevelopmentThe firmware is built on the LoRaWAN_End_Node example from the STM32WL SDK17.Low Power ConfigurationTo ensure the battery lasts longer than the previous 14-day limit, the MCU must enter Stop2 Mode between measurement cycles181818.Use the stm32_seq.h sequencer to schedule tasks without using a full RTOS19.Ensure all unused GPIOs are set to Analog mode to minimize leakage current20.Sensor Logic (lora_app.c)Command: Issue the 0xFD command for a high-precision measurement21.Timing: Use a 20ms non-blocking delay to allow the sensor to finish conversion22.Data Integrity: Read 6 bytes from the sensor; verify the CRC-8 checksums for both temperature and humidity23.Payload StructureTo minimize Time-on-Air (ToA) and save energy, use the Cayenne LPP format24:Channel 1 (Type 103): Temperature (Value $\times$ 10)252525.Channel 2 (Type 115): Packet Counter26.Security: The stack automatically applies AES-128 encryption to the payload27.4. Gateway and Backend ConfigurationPacket ForwarderThe Raspberry Pi runs the Semtech Packet Forwarder, which bridges RF packets to IP packets (UDP/JSON)282828.Configure global_conf.json with the correct frequency plan (US915 for UCR)292929.Ensure the Gateway ID in the config matches the one registered in ChirpStack30.ChirpStack DecodingIn the ChirpStack web console, add a Javascript Codec to decode the hex payload31.JavaScript// Example decoder logic
function decodeUplink(input) {
  var temp = (input.bytes[2] << 8 | input.bytes[3]) / 10.0; // Channel 1 [cite: 64, 65]
  return { data: { temperature: temp } };
}
5. Testing and ValidationOTAA Handshake: Monitor the ChirpStack console during power-up to ensure a successful Join-Request/Join-Accept cycle32.Thermal Test: Blow warm air onto the SHT45 and verify the real-time data spike in the backend33.Range Check: Expect a Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) of roughly 25% at 30 meters in non-line-of-sight conditions; the 3-second uplink frequency provides sufficient redundancy to handle this loss34.6. Future ImprovementsEnergy Harvesting: Integrate a solar panel to eliminate battery swaps entirely35.Edge AI: Implement local anomaly detection on the STM32WL to only transmit data when a temperature deviation is detected36.Visualization: Connect ChirpStack to InfluxDB and Grafana for professional-grade analytics37.
